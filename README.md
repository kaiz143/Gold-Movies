Project Name: Movie Gold v1

Overview: This project, Movie Gold v1, is a React-based movie client application that fetches and displays data from an API I created using Spring Boot. This is my first API project, and the application is designed to showcase movie details through a user-friendly interface.

Features:

Carousel for movie posters using Material-UI.
Integration with Axios for smooth API calls and data fetching.
UI enhancements with FontAwesome icons and Material-UI components.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: React, Material-UI, FontAwesome
Backend/API: Spring Boot
Additional Libraries: Axios
Challenges Faced: During development, I encountered challenges with module imports, especially with FontAwesome (@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core). I also tackled rendering issues and prop handling in the component hierarchy, making this a great learning experience in debugging and component structuring in React.

This project is an exploration into API creation and integration, frontend design, and React component optimization. Looking forward to expanding this further!
